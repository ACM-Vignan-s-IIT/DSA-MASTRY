# Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript

## What are Data Structures and Algorithms?

Data Structures are the ways of organizing and storing data to perform operations efficiently, while Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. Together, they form the backbone of computer science and are crucial for developing efficient and optimized software.

## Why Learn DSA in JavaScript?

JavaScript, known primarily as a language for web development, has become a versatile language over the years. Learning Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript is essential for enhancing problem-solving skills, optimizing code, and preparing for technical interviews.

## Key Data Structures in JavaScript

1. **Arrays**: Ordered, indexed collections of values.
2. **Linked Lists**: Dynamic structures with nodes and references.
3. **Stacks and Queues**: Manage data based on specific principles.
4. **Hash Tables**: Use hash functions for fast access.
5. **Trees and Graphs**: Hierarchical structures for relationships.

## Key Algorithms in JavaScript

1. **Sorting Algorithms**: Essential for organizing data efficiently.
2. **Searching Algorithms**: Locate specific elements in data structures.
3. **Recursion**: A powerful technique for problem-solving.
